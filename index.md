# Welcome!

This is the website for the UK research community, academic and industrial,
interested in problems relating generally to computer systems. That includes
both the more traditional topics such as operating systems, distributed systems
and networking, as well as more current challenges and approaches at scales from
edge and mobile computing to datacenter and the cloud. If your work has bearing
on how we should go about building practical computer systems, it's of interest!

**_PROGRAMME AVAILABLE_** The programme for the [third iteration of the
Community's informal workshop](/workshop/2018) (March 21---23, 2018 in beautiful
Northumberland) is now available along with venue and transport details!

General registration will open once we've given accepted authors a chance to
register. Watch this space!

Brief details of previous workshops are [available here](/workshop).

Contact [Richard Mortier][mort] (<mailto:richard.mortier@cl.cam.ac.uk>) for more
details or any questions.
