# Welcome!

This is the website for the UK research community, academic and industrial,
interested in problems relating generally to computer systems. That includes
both the more traditional topics such as operating systems, distributed systems
and networking, as well as more current challenges and approaches at scales from
edge and mobile computing to datacenter and the cloud. If your work has bearing
on how we should go about building practical computer systems, it's of interest!

**_EARLY NOTICE_** We are now starting to organise the [fourth iteration of the
Community's informal workshop](/workshop/2019) (March 27---29, 2019 in beautiful
Northumberland). Details will be posted as they unfold!

General registration will open once we've given accepted authors a chance to
register. Watch this space!

Details of previous workshops are [available here](/workshop).

Contact [Richard Mortier][mort] (<mailto:richard.mortier@cl.cam.ac.uk>) for more
details or any questions.
