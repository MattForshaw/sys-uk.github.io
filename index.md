# Welcome!

This is the website for the UK research community, academic and industrial,
interested in problems relating generally to computer systems. That includes
both the more traditional topics such as operating systems, distributed systems
and networking, as well as more current challenges and approaches at scales from
edge and mobile computing to datacenter and the cloud. If your work has bearing
on how we should go about building practical computer systems, it's of interest!

We are now putting together the [third iteration of an informal workshop for the
community](/workshop/2018), scheduled for March 21---23, 2018 in Northumberland,
where we can discuss work addressing current and future challenges in systems
computing. With that in mind, we have a [Call for Papers][cfp] up inviting short
0.5pp / 500 word abstracts for presentation. Both UK and international
participants are very welcome, and we particularly hope to receive submissions
from Ph.D. students and early career researchers.

**_DEADLINE EXTENDED!_ By popular request, the submission deadline has been
extended to 23:59 Saturday February 17th. Please do consider submitting via <https://hotcrp.sysws.org.uk/>!**

So-- if you have an interest in systems research [please do consider
submitting](https://hotcrp.sysws.org.uk/)!

Brief details of previous workshops are [available here](/workshop).

Contact [Richard Mortier][mort] <mailto:richard.mortier@cl.cam.ac.uk> for more
details or any questions.
