Abstract
--------
Introduction of storage-class memory (SCM) in tomorrow's memory systems has the potential to enable affordable large-scale graph analytics on a single machine. However, to make sure that SCM-based scale-up graph processing achieves its full performance potential, various aspects of software and hardware must be rethought in light of combined constraints of SCM and graph applications.
