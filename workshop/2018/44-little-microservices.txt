Abstract
--------
Microservices as an architectural approach has been riding the hype curve for the past few years. The jury’s still out on whether it is a fundamentally different approach to building applications, let alone whether or not it is right for anyone other than a few Unicorns. Success stories are slowing appearing but matched by failures. In this presentation we’ll look at some microservice realities and try to pick out fact versus myth, answering questions like: Are monoliths really bad? How big can I make my pizza team (and does pineapple help) and hence microservice? What should be the unity of deployment when looking at microservices? Where do distributed systems practices of old fit into microservices in the 21st century?
