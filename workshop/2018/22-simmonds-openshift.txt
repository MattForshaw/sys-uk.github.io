Abstract
--------

Users demand tailored, dynamic, and constantly refined experiences: they expect
intelligent applications that will learn from data and improve with longevity
and popularity. Application intelligence can take many forms, including anomaly
detection, recommendations, natural-language understanding, and speech and image
recognition. All of these capabilities need to be put into production and
managed alongside conventional application components.

In this session you will learn how OpenShift enables cross-functional teams to
develop intelligent applications. We’ll cover microservice architectures for
creating, sharing, deploying, and reusing intelligent application components as
containerized microservices. We’ll discuss how development teams can add
intelligence to applications without dedicated AI developers. The talk will
conclude with an extended case study showing just how OpenShift enabled a senior
engineer to go from prototype to production with an intelligent application. You
will leave with a solid inspiration for how to take your applications to the
next level with intelligent features and concrete suggestions for getting
started with OpenShift.
