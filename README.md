# UK Systems Community Pages

This is the website for the UK research community, academic and industrial,
interested in problems relating generally to computer systems. That includes
both the more traditional topics such as operating systems, distributed systems
and networking, as well as more current challenges and approaches at scales from
edge and mobile computing to datacenter and the cloud. If your work has bearing
on how we should go about building practical computer systems, it's of interest!
